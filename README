- keylayout
    Toggle with shift+caps. There are two - one augmented with math symbols,
    the other is based on the X11 Latvian layout, but better.

    Not sure how much this is of use to anyone,
    but I'll gladly archive it here.

- remote
    I tried using xkbmap-remote, but settled on actkbd, remote and remote.conf.
    They're key remappings for my cheap RF presentation remote.
